title: Adapters
---
An **adapter** is the one declaration kind where a Bynk capability *contract*
sits adjacent to a non-Bynk *implementation*. It is the **only** place the host
boundary may exist — the single, named, greppable seam through which a
deploy-target runtime or an npm library enters a Bynk program. Everything else
stays pure Bynk.

An adapter declares capabilities and the boundary types they reference, names a
TypeScript **binding** that supplies the implementations, and `exports` the
capabilities to consumers. It may **not** declare services or agents, and its
providers are **external** (bodiless).

## Anatomy

```bynk,fragment
adapter tokens {
  binding "./tokens.binding.ts" requires { "jose": "^5" }
  consumes bynk { Secrets }     // v0.18: adapter-to-adapter dependency

  exports capability  { Jwt }
  exports transparent { Claims, JwtError }

  type Claims   = { sub: String, exp: Int }
  type JwtError = enum { Invalid, Expired }

  capability Jwt {
    fn sign(claims: Claims) -> Effect[String]
    fn verify(token: String) -> Effect[Result[Claims, JwtError]]
  }

  provides Jwt = JoseJwt given Secrets   // external: no body; supplied by the binding
}
```

- **`binding "<module>"`** names the TypeScript module (resolved relative to the
  adapter's source file) that exports the provider symbols. `requires { … }`
  declares npm dependencies; ranges must be pinned (no `*`/`latest`). A
  dependency package's adapter declares them the same way, and they install
  with the consuming project's own when it reaches that adapter; two adapters
  requiring one npm package must state the same range. The
  binding is an **ES module**, checked as one: relative imports name the `.js`
  file (`from "./runtime.js"`, not `"./runtime"`, which `tsc` rejects with
  TS2835), and CommonJS idioms (`require`, `module.exports`, `__dirname`) are
  not available.
- **`includes ["./x.wasm", …]`** (after the module, before `requires`) ships
  WebAssembly modules beside the binding. Each path is relative to the adapter's
  file and must stay inside its directory (no absolute path, no `..`:
  `bynk.adapter.include_outside`), end in `.wasm` (`bynk.adapter.include_kind`),
  exist (`bynk.adapter.include_missing`) and appear once
  (`bynk.adapter.include_duplicate`). The compiler copies each file byte for
  byte beside the emitted binding and generates `./x.wasm.js`, whose default
  export is the compiled `WebAssembly.Module`; the runtime's `loadWasm(module,
  imports?)` instantiates it. The binding imports both and never knows whether
  it is on Workers (Wrangler compiles the module; the generated `wrangler.toml`
  gains an explicit `CompiledWasm` rule) or under `bynk test` (the module is
  inlined and compiled at load). Included modules work in dependency packages
  too. `includes` is a contextual word: it is an ordinary identifier everywhere
  else.

  **Trust.** An included module is code from the package, like the binding that
  loads it: a dependency's module is part of its checksummed tree, so the lock
  pins its bytes, and it needs no approval of its own (the npm approval gate
  governs only what npm brings in). It runs with the binding's reach, sandboxed
  by the wasm instance and given only the imports the binding passes.
- **`provides Cap = Name`** with **no brace block** is an *external* provider:
  the compiler emits no class, and the binding must `export class Name implements
  Cap`. The `implements` is checked by `tsc --strict` — that is the contract
  between the two halves.
- **`consumes U { Cap, … }`** (v0.18) brings another adapter's capabilities into
  scope for the adapter's providers — see
  [Adapter dependencies](#adapter-dependencies) below.

## Adapter dependencies

An adapter may depend on **another adapter's** capabilities (v0.18). Its
`consumes` is restricted on two axes, each with its own diagnostic:

- **braced form only** — an adapter has no services to call, so the whole-unit
  and `as Alias` forms are rejected (`bynk.adapter.consumes_requires_selection`);
- **adapter targets only** — an adapter may not consume a *context*
  (`bynk.adapter.consumes_context`).

An external provider names its dependencies with the ordinary `given`; compose
builds a **by-name deps object** and passes it to the binding class
constructor:

```typescript
// tokens.binding.ts — keys are the `given` names, checked by tsc
export class JoseJwt implements Jwt {
  constructor(private deps: { Secrets: Secrets }) {}
  // … this.deps.Secrets.get("JWT_SECRET") …
}
```

```typescript
// compose.ts (generated) — the dependency is instantiated recursively
const Jwt = new tokens__binding.JoseJwt({
  Secrets: new bynk__binding.SecretsProvider(),
});
```

The wiring is transitive: depending on a capability pulls its provider's
binding into the compose (and *its* dependencies, recursively). This is how
config and IO reach a binding — a secret or an HTTP client is a capability
dependency (`given bynk.Secrets`, `given bynk.Fetch`), never an operation
parameter or an env read in application code.

## The three flavours

| Flavour | Binding | Portability |
|---|---|---|
| **Library adapter** | one, npm-backed, user-authored | runs anywhere |
| **The `bynk` surface** | one per platform, toolchain-supplied | portable |
| **Platform adapter** (`bynk.<platform>`) | one, platform-only, toolchain-supplied | **platform-locked** |

The **`bynk` surface** is the reserved, agnostic conformance core shipped with
the toolchain. The `bynk` root namespace is reserved — no user unit may be
named `bynk` or `bynk.*` — and every first-party adapter lives inside it: the
surface unit `bynk` (consuming only it keeps code **portable**) and the
`bynk.<platform>` platform adapters (consuming one **locks** the deployment
unit — the prefix means *first-party*, not *portable*). As of v0.18 the surface
carries the full ambient set:

| Capability | Ops | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `Clock` | `now() -> Effect[Instant]` | an absolute point in time (epoch-millis under the hood) |
| `Random` | `uuid() -> Effect[Uuid]`, `int(lo, hi) -> Effect[Int]` | `Uuid` is refined |
| `Logger` | `info(msg)`, `error(msg)` | |
| `Fetch` | `send(req: Request) -> Effect[Result[Response, FetchError]]` | typed core; see below |
| `Secrets` | `get(name: String) -> Effect[Option[String]]` | env-backed per platform |

`Fetch`'s `Request` carries `method` (`Method` enum), `url`,
`contentType`/`authorization`/`body` as `Option[String]` fields, and
`headers: Map[String, String]` for any other request header. `headers` is a
required field, so a request that sends no extra headers says
`headers: Map.empty()`. `Response` carries `status`, `headers` (keys
lowercased) and `body`. See
[the `bynk` capabilities reference](/book/reference/bynk-capabilities/#request-and-response-headers)
for the conflict and forbidden-header rules, which return `Err(InvalidHeader)`.

### Platforms

The deploy **platform** (`--platform {cloudflare,node}`, default `cloudflare`)
selects which `bynk-<platform>.ts` binding is linked. It is distinct from
`--target {bundle,workers}`, which chooses emit topology. Because the `bynk`
contract names canonical provider symbols, the generated compose is
platform-identical — only the imported binding module differs. Porting Bynk to
a new runtime means implementing this one adapter's interfaces.

### Platform adapters & the lock

A **platform adapter** exposes a platform's real infrastructure as it is — no
portable intersection. The toolchain ships `bynk.cloudflare` (`Kv` since
v0.19; `putTtl`/`list` since v0.23):

| Capability | Ops | Binding maps to |
|---|---|---|
| `Kv` | `get(key) -> Effect[Option[String]]`, `put(key, value) -> Effect[()]`, `putTtl(key, value, ttlSeconds) -> Effect[()]`, `delete(key) -> Effect[()]`, `list(prefix: Option[String]) -> Effect[List[String]]` | the Worker KV namespace at `env.KV` |

`putTtl` writes with an `expirationTtl`. `list` is a **drain**: the binding
follows the cursor internally and returns every matching key name — eager
and unbounded, so prefer a prefix on large namespaces (cursor-paging is
deferred; see ADR 0050).

**Structured values** are composition with the v0.22 codec, not extra ops —
store `Json.encode(entry)`, read back through `Json.decode[Entry]`:

```bynk,fragment
service cache {
  on call(key: String, e: Entry) -> Effect[Option[Entry]] given Kv {
    let _ <- Kv.putTtl(key, Json.encode(e), 60)
    let stored <- Kv.get(key)
    match stored {
      Some(s) => match Json.decode[Entry](s) {
        Ok(decoded) => Some(decoded)
        Err(_) => None
      }
      None => None
    }
  }
}
```

```bynk
context cache.store {
  consumes bynk.cloudflare { Kv }   // locks this deployment unit to cloudflare

  service cache {
    on call(key: String, value: String) -> Effect[Option[String]] given Kv {
      let previous <- Kv.get(key)
      let _ <- Kv.put(key, value)
      previous
    }
  }
}
```

Consuming it is **derived plumbing, not configuration**: the Worker's `Env`
gains a typed `KV: KVNamespace` field, its `wrangler.toml` a
`[[kv_namespaces]]` stanza (fill in the namespace `id` at deploy time), and on
the `bundle` target `composeApp` gains an optional `env` parameter to thread
the namespace through. The application never touches `env`.

It also **locks the deployment unit** — each context under `--target workers`,
the whole program under `bundle` — to the platform, along in-process `given`
edges (a service `consumes` between contexts is RPC and does not propagate).
Building with a different `--platform` is `bynk.target.vendor_required`;
spanning two native platforms in one deployment unit is
`bynk.target.vendor_conflict`. The `bynk` surface and library adapters never
lock; a remote vendor API over HTTPS belongs in a library adapter (`given
bynk.Fetch`), which stays portable. `Kv.list`, structured values, and `Queue`
arrive with the v0.22 extension.

## Consuming an adapter

A context `consumes` an adapter exactly as it consumes another context. Selected
capabilities can be flattened to bare names:

```bynk,fragment
context auth.sessions {
  consumes bynk   { Logger }   // portable
  consumes tokens { Jwt }      // library adapter; bare `Jwt` in scope

  service login {
    on call() -> Effect[String] given Jwt, Logger {
      let _     <- Logger.info("issuing token")
      let token <- Jwt.sign(Claims { sub: "u1", exp: 0 })
      token
    }
  }
}
```

`consumes U { Cap, … }` flattens the named capabilities into the consumer's local
namespace, so they read as `given Cap` / `Cap.op(…)` — identical to a locally
declared capability. The emitted TypeScript is the same as the qualified
`given U.Cap` form.

A consumed adapter is wired **in-process** (its binding is instantiated in the
composition root), never over a Service Binding — an adapter is not a deployment
unit.

## The binding as privileged constructor

A binding constructs its adapter's boundary types, which deliberately pierces
Bynk's construction discipline (only the defining unit may construct a type).
Inside a binding that rule does not apply — the binding *is* the host boundary.
To avoid coupling to the emitter's lowering, bindings construct boundary values
**only through the emitted constructors** — `Ok`/`Err`/`Some`/`None` from
`runtime.js`, a sum type's `T.Variant`, a record as an object literal, and a
**refined type through its validating `.of`** (handling the `Result`; a raw cast
bypasses the predicate and is disallowed — and a refined type emits no `.unsafe`
to call in the first place, ADR 0182).
